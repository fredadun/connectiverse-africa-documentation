### Trust Score Components
- **Verification Badges**: Each badge contributes points to the trust score
  - Identity Verification: 15 points
  - Revenue Verification: 20 points
  - Document Verification: 20 points
  - Location Verification: 15 points
  - Ownership Verification: 15 points
  
- **User Reviews**: Average rating contributes up to 25 points

### Trust Score Calculation Formula
```
Trust Score = Sum of Verification Points +

              Endorsement Points + 
              Profile Completeness Points +
